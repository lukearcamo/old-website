            <div id="subtitle">By Luke Arcamo — July 8, 2021</div>
            In the <a class="link" href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html#ga37bd57223967b4211d60ca1a0bf3c832">GLFW documentation</a>,
            it says that "On some platforms, a window move, resize or menu operation will cause event processing to block. This is due to how event processing is designed on those platforms."
            This can be a problem since it causes the rendering to freeze until the operation is complete.
            The documentation suggests a fix using the window refresh callback, however personally, I haven't had success with this method since the callback kept triggering constantly,
            and the documentation also mentions that this method does not work for compositing window systems.
            Another easy fix is to just ignore the freezing, or make the window fullscreen so there is no window resizing/moving. If this cannot be done,
            many forum posts I have encountered suggest multithreading, but personally, I have found little information and few examples on how to do this. So, after my own
            experimentation and research, I wrote this article to help explain this.
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: var(--white); padding-top: 10vh;">
            <h1>probleM</h1>
            <p>
                I'll assume that your regular GLFW code is more or less structured in the standard way, like so:
            </p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void initialize() {
    // Initialize GLFW, OpenGL, etc.
}
void draw() {
    // OpenGL rendering stuff
}
int main() {
    init();

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        draw();
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    // Clean up OpenGL & GLFW

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                Here we can see the issue: when the window is dragged or resized, the program gets stuck at glfwPollEvents() until the window is let go. And, since rendering occurs within
                in the same loop, it freezes as well. To fix this, we can run these two things on separate threads.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: var(--white);">
            <h1>solution</h1>
            <h2>bAsic threAd usAge</h2>
            <p>
                From C++11 onward, threading is supported using the <code>&lt;thread&gt;</code> header.
                Creating a thread is simple:
                <code>std::thread myThread(function_to_run_on_thread);</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                To finish the thread after the function returns, use <code>myThread.join();</code> on the main thread, which will pause the main thread until the other thread has finished and returned.
                This function should be called near the end of the main() function, so that the other thread finishes smoothly without any errors or warnings.
            </p>
            <h2>putting opengl contexts on other threAds</h2>
            <p>
                According to the GLFW documentation, the event processing functions <code>glfwPollEvents</code> and <code>glfwWaitEvents</code> must only be called from the main thread.
                Fortunately, OpenGL can be run on a separate thread from the main one.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, there is another important piece of information from the <a class="link" href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__context.html#ga1c04dc242268f827290fe40aa1c91157">GLFW documentation</a>.
                "When moving a context between threads, you must make it non-current on the old thread before making it current on the new one."
                This means that in the main thread, after loading OpenGL in your initialize function while the context is current,
                <code>glfwMakeContextCurrent(NULL)</code> must be called afterwards to make the context non-current, and then <code>glfwMakeContextCurrent</code> must be called again within the other thread to make the context current there.
            </p>
            <h2>event hAndling</h2>
            <p>
                Additionally, since events are handled on a separate thread from rendering, unless you plan on doing other stuff in the main loop, you can actually use
                <code>glfwWaitEvents</code> rather than <code>glfwPollEvents</code>, because rendering will continue regardless of the main thread being paused. On my device, this even increased
                performance because events are no longer constantly being polled. However, I have not tested this on other platforms so this may differ for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, GLFW supports callbacks for its events, like <code>glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback</code> and <code>glfwSetKeyCallback</code>. However, these callbacks are called on the main thread
                where events are handled. This means that calling OpenGL commands within these functions will not work, because the OpenGL context is not available within the main thread.
                The way I overcame this was to make the callbacks set flag variables outside of them, which can then be polled within the render thread's loop.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All together, the new code should be structured like so:
            </p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void initialize() {
    // Initialize GLFW, loading library, etc.
}
// Example event handling
bool hasResized = false;
float width = 960.0, height = 540.0;
void onResize(GLFWwindow* window, int w, int h) {
    width = w;
    height = h;
    hasResized = true;
}
void draw() {
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(insert_your_context_variable_here);

    // Setup OpenGL stuff

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        if (hasResized) {
            // Handle resize event here (call glViewport, update projection matrices, etc.)
        }
        // Draw OpenGL stuff
    }
}
int main() {
    init();
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(NULL);
    std::thread renderThread(draw);

    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
        glfwWaitEvents();
    }

    renderThread.join();

    // Clean up OpenGL & GLFW

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
