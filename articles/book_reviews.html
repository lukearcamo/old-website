            <div id="subtitle">By Luke Arcamo ‚Äî November 9, 2022 - Now (updated periodically)</div>
            I have always been reading since I was young, mostly fantasy and non-fiction, but this year I discovered a passion for other genres of short stories and novels. These notes have been sitting in a google doc for a while now. I decided to publish it so that others can get a window into who I am and what goes on inside my head.
            <i>Warning</i>: Contains some spoilers.

            <h1>high school</h1>
            For grade 11 and 12.

            <h3><i>Hedda Gabler</i> <small>by Henrik Ibsen</small></h3>
            <small>September 2020</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Enjoyed noticing the subtle body language and speech patterns revealing the complex web of interpersonal relationships.</li>
                <li>Did not always agree with Hedda's worldview, but that is precisely why I think she would be an interesting person to talk to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>The Scarlet Letter</i> <small>by Nathaniel Hawthorne</small></h3>
            <small>September-October 2020</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Prose was difficult to understand at times and probably increased the book's length threefold ‚Äî somewhat understandable given the novel writing was still new.</li>
                <li>The ending's depiction of Hester and Pearl's quiet triumph over society was inspiring.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Persepolis</i> <small>by Marjane Satrapi</small></h3>
            <small>November 2020</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Marjane's resilience is inspiring.</li>
                <li>Learned a lot about Iranian history, and its cultural differences with the West both before and after revolution.</li>
                <li>Her grandmother's message of "stay true to yourself" articulated and clarified what has formed a core part of my personal principles for a long time, and this message continues to stick with me today.</li>
                <li>Edit November 11, 2022: Now that I'm reading <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, the intertextuality is strong with these two, and I appreciate both books even more.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>The Great Gatsby</i> <small>by F. Scott Fitzgerald</small></h3>
            <small>November 2021</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>The ending had a poignant, wistful feeling ‚Äî <i>Mono no aware</i></li>
                <li>Underlying discussion of social class, a topic I never really knew or explored much of beforehand.</li>
                <li>Every character is complex, and so are the relationships between them.</li>
                <li>This upper class world was obviously not something I was familiar with, yet it was still interesting enough to allow me to become emotionally invested with the characters, the beautiful imagery, and the overall plot.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Waiting for Godot</i> <small>by Samuel Beckett</small></h3>
            <small>December 2021</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Loved the minimalism.</li>
                <li>Many beautiful quotes and speeches.</li>
                <li>Did not feel boring or repetitive in any way. It felt like there were new things happening all the time, which can likely be attributed to the comedy and varied dialogue. Even though its comedy does not exactly match my tastes, I still admire it because I don't think the play would stand otherwise.</li>
                <li>Opened my eyes to the ideas of existentialism which helped me through a turbulent liminal period of my life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SCP</h3>
            <small>January 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>The number of hours I have sunk into this rabbit hole is excessive üíÄ</li>
                <li>Must read for newcomers (introduces the universe and background context): <a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/guide-for-newcomers">https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/guide-for-newcomers</a></li>
                <li>It is a collaborative and public writing project, so the quality of works falls under a normal distribution. Nevertheless, there is quality control in the form of a greenlighting process and a rating system, so there are a substantial amount of gems.</li>
                <li>Because writers come from a variety of backgrounds bringing their personal experiences and expertise, the worldbuilding is so expansive and realistic.</li>
                <li>Despite being linked by a shared universe, the philosophy of ‚Äúthere is no canon‚Äù allows for such a diversity of genres, formats, and media, from short stories to novel-length stories, scientific documents to highly-vernacular language, horror to comedy to tragedy, sci-fi to historical fiction, glitched documents, and even visual arts. This was one of the ways I was able to expand my horizons and discover genres I never would have read otherwise, and it has also taught me not to judge genres too rigidly.</li>
                <li>I would like to write here someday but I don't have any ideas yet</li>
                <li>Story personal recommendations for newcomers (don't require much in-universe knowledge):
                    <ul>
                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/revenants">Revenants</a> by Photosynthetic</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fav skips. SCPs are generally meant to be standalone so only basic in-universe knowledge is required. CW: horror:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-184">SCP-184 "The Architect"</a> and the accompanying exploration log (CW: horror)</li>
                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000">SCP-3000 "Anantashesha"</a> (CW: thalassophobia, cosmic horror)</li>

                </li>
                <li>Series/Hub recommendations. Since a lot of these stories belong to multiple canons, they require more in-universe understanding:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub">Antimemetics Division</a>. Was published into an actual novel. Creative premise. Good for newcomers.</li>

                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/those-twisted-pines-hub">Those Twisted Pines</a>. Packed with emotion and action.</li>
                        <li><a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/third-law-hub">Third Law.</a> This is unlike anything else on this list of stories, and unlike anything on my list of preferences at the bottom of this page. Nevertheless, it is genre boundary-breaking, action-packed, and entertaining.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>My chrome bookmarks are filled with so many more stories I can't fit onto this list üíÄ</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><i>Collected Fictions</i> <small>by Jorge Luis Borges</small></h3>
            <small>September 2021 - Unfinished</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
            <p>TBD</p>

            <h3><i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> <small>by Ted Chiang</small></h3>
            <small>December 2021</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <p>TBD</p>

            <h3><i>Dune</i> <small>by Frank Herbert</small></h3>
            <small>May 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
            <ul>
                <li>One of my all-time favourite books.</li>
                <li>Detailed fascinating culture, both the Fremen and the Imperium</li>
                <li>Complex politics was engaging</li>
                <li>Did not spoon feed information. This was sometimes confusing regarding the meaning of made-up words. Nevertheless it added to the immersion, because it felt like learning a language ‚Äî you learn the meaning as you go along. Words that are mentioned once with no explanation can simply be understood with context, yet add so much depth, as if the universe is grander than what is shown on the pages.</li>
                <li>The subversion of heroic themes, more evident in Dune Messiah, was creative.</li>
                <li>Loved the ecological themes ‚Äî relatively unique among sci-fi, and doesn't seem like it would fit in with this story but it does.</li>
                <li>The Baron feels comically evil and heavy-handed. He is politically and socially competent, but it felt like he was no match for Paul. Piter De Vries would have made a more devious and dangerous villain ‚Äî like Paul, he was also on spice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Dune Messiah</i> <small>by Frank Herbert</small></h3>
            <small>May 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <p>TBD</p>

            <h3><i>Love That Dog</i> <small>by Sharon Creech</small><br><i>Hate That Cat</i> <small>by Sharon Creech</small></h3>
            <small>May 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
            <ul>
                <li>A children's book that somehow skillfully combines cuteness with difficult topics.</li>
                <li>Realistic insight into the mind of a child ‚Äî they have a capacity for adult thinking, and it is simply the expression of it that is limited by language.</li>
                <li>Gained a better understanding of poetry as so much more than just Dr. Seuss's rhymes and Shakespeare's complicated language.</li>
                <li>Despite containing tragedy, the ending is really wholesome.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Piranesi</i> <small>by Susanna Clarke</small></h3>
            <small>June 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Unique setting, abstract and architectural, like Borges' library. The lack of a background explanation gives the impression that it was never created, it has always existed since the beginning of time. Furthermore, Piranesi's understanding of the structure and inner-workings of the House, down to the weather patterns and natural resources, was immersive.</li>
                <li>Piranesi's childlike wonder and na√Øvet√© (talking to birds/statues, thoughts, letters to 16, new shoes, trust in the Other, idealism) was charming. Reminded me of Jack from Crech's books above.</li>
                <li>The crime mystery intertwined within the story was the cherry on top.</li>
                <li>In the end, Piranesi's longing to return to the house embodies a homesickness and nostalgia which I can relate to ‚Äî Despite its discomforts, despite having all the amenities and people of the Other World, the House will always hold a special place in his heart.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream</i> <small>by Harlan Elison</small></h3>
            <small>June 24, 2022 - August 20, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>The short story:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pain.</li>
                        <li>The ending's immense sacrifice, followed by a vague sense of smug, content nihilism and continued internal defiance against the AI when all hope seems lost was powerful.</li>
                        <li>Intertextuality: Reminds me of <a class="link" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/like-clockwork-hub">this</a> from SCP (see above). Would not recommend reading these two back-to-back.</li>
                        <li>A bit hard to visualize the environment or the characters, but it seemed surreal like in <i>Waiting for Godot</i>.</li>
                        <li>The ending felt a bit too easy ‚Äî how did he manage to outsmart AM? Didn't it make death impossible? And how did AM not react fast enough?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The whole anthology:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Psychedelic, Disorienting ‚Äî Vivid but sometimes difficult to follow sudden shifts in POV.</li>
                        <li>Skillful with use of language ‚Äî Polysyndeton and compounding of adjectives adds to the vivid imagery, incorporating all senses not just vision. Occasional strange sentence structure, difficult to understand at first but eventually makes sense for its efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Philosophical themes</li>
                        <li><small>something something death of the author, please do not cancel üôÇ</small></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Cathedral (short story collection)</i> <small>by Raymond Carver</small></h3>
            <small>June 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>I couldn't finish it after the first three stories.</li>
                <li>Tries to be purely emotional, with a lack of worldbuilding, leading to it feeling shallow, dry, unimpactful, unimaginative</li>
                <li>It didn't feel like it was trying to tell me anything. The dialogue feels dry and lacks meaningful information.</li>
                <li>No beautiful poetic sentences. The narration's particular flavour of colloquial language is ill-suited to the melancholic or profound atmosphere it aims to achieve.</li>
                <li>Writing is already a minimalistic medium, but even though I enjoy minimalism, too much of it makes for a bland piece. Even Mondrian gives something for the eyes to do, but a blank canvas is just reaching.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Fallen Angels</i> <small>by Walter Dean Myers</small></h3>
            <small>July - August 21, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>First experience reading a war novel ‚Äî very different to the big-picture way war is depicted in history class, which is what I was used to.</li>
                <li>Visceral imagery ‚Äî The reader can almost feel the characters' pain and relief.</li>
                <li>The author has a broad dynamic range of language styles, from vernacular slang to poetic imagery ‚Äî a telltale sign of an author's writing skill.</li>
                <li>Did not just recount physical experiences. Philosophical questions were asked as well: sympathy and understanding of similarities towards enemies, psychological effects of war, truth and propaganda, corruption in bureaucracy, racism, fear, masculinity.</li>
                <li>This is apparently a frequently censored or challenged book. Although there is offensive or "outdated" terminology, violence, racism, drugs, etc., this is not a valid reason to censor or cancel any book. It is the reader's responsibility to view any idea through the lense of its historical context. It is not the author's responsibility to cater to a reader's individual subjective feelings, but to merely present the truth as accurately and objectively as possible; it definitely isn't as if Myers was endorsing these things in any way. The reader has the freedom to put their book down, but not to put everyone else's book down.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>The Joy Luck Club</i> <small>by Amy Tan</small></h3>
            <small>July - August 23, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>It is incredibly satisfying to see seemingly insignificant details become surprisingly important poetic motifs later on. My favourite chapter, the perfect example of this, is Lena St. Clair - The Voice from the Wall</li>
                <li>Ambiguous turbulent emotions, interconnected stories</li>
                <li>Contrary to many other people's <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_Luck_Club_(novel)#Reception">views</a>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I did not find the portrayal of China as backwards</li>
                        <li>I did not find that Asian men were portrayed as a negative stereotype. In fact, many of the women had family members that cared about them, and the ones that are clearly bad, like Wu Tsing, are not entirely representative of Chinese culture because they are Westernized. The portrayal only seems biased because the good men tend to be background characters. Thus, I do agree that they could have been developed further.</li>
                        <li>The folk tales did not feel carelessly interchangeable with CJKV culture. I think it would be more unfitting if only the popular Confuscian folk tales were mentioned.
                        <ul>
                            <li>First of all, China is a big place and, like in other parts of the world, folk tales can vary throughout the country, even from town to town. Individual experiences vary, and unless you did comprehensive research, you cannot definitively say that a folktale is fake.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, a defining feature of oral traditions is that they tend to change stories dynamically to the point of unrecognizability; a game of broken telephone is a common analogy.</li>
                            <li>Lastly, often folk tales can also be spontaneously made up by individuals, rather than passed down. After all, even the oldest folk tales haven't always existed. Personally I remember stories when I was younger which I thought were folk tales or superstitions from my culture, but were simply bedtime stories told to make us behave, or gossip I overheard and misunderstood. In the end, this isn't a reference book on Chinese culture; what matters is the moral of the story.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>The Green Hills of Earth</i> <small>by Robert A. Heinlein</small></h3>
            <small>July - August 23, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>A taste of the Golden Age of sci-fi rather than the New Wave I prefer and am accustomed to.</li>
                <li>Wholesome poignancy</li>
                <li>High verisimilitude; unique biographical article format</li>
                <li>New Wave aspects begin to show through, like a greater focus on the human aspect rather than the fantastical science, though technical jargon was still present. From my modern scientific perspective their science appears quaint, but not in a negative way. Like he was belittling the jungle terraformation of Venus lol, little did the author know how immense of an achievement that would be.</li>
                <li>Nostalgia/homesickness, like in <i>Piranesi</i>, was relatable</li>
                <li>Note how the the dangers in sci-fi stories reflect contemporary technology. Back when nuclear bombs were new, radiation was the greatest mysterious threat. Now, with cyberpunk, the various digital threats of AI, lack of privacy, capitalism and government corruption are top of mind.</li>

            <small>September - October 10, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
            <ul>
                <li>Favourite book next to <i>Dune</i>; slightly less overtly grandiose, but the worldbuilding feels cosmic in scale nonetheless.</li>
                <li>I did not expect this book to be so highly emotional. The magnitude of Estraven's sacrifice is astonishing.</li>
                <li>Even though this is soft sci-fi, Le Guin still pays attention to the science ‚Äî relativity, climate, even Hubble's constant. That footnote was particularly fascinating even though it was irrelevant to the story.</li>
                <li>Writing style
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vivid poetic imagery, so much slice of life, small sensory details; as the afterword says, it adds a touch of optimism amid such bleak conditions.</li>
                        <li>Epistolary format adds to the realism.</li>
                        <li>I love nonlinear storytelling ‚Äî the myths interspersed between current events also adds to the realism.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Characters ‚Äî Every character is so complex. Even the main characters both have imperfections, and no character is clearly evil or the antagonist. Conflict stems from human mistakes, human na√Øvet√©.</li>
                <li>Motifs like duality, <i>nusuth</i>, and darkness make the numerous themes feel cohesive:</li>
                <li>Themes
                    <ul>
                        <li>Politics, Corruption, Violence, Power ‚Äî The fact that these are still present in Gethenian society speaks volumes about conflict and the thirst for power being inherent to human nature. Like <i>Dune</i>, they add complexity to the story, but stay away from being the central focus. Instead, there is more focus on lower-level human relationships instead.</li>
                        <li>Culture ‚Äî Two main influencing factors that make it differ from our culture: Winter and Gender. Other than those, everything is strikingly similar to our culture ‚Äî they have conflict, love, loyalty, betrayal, politics, survival, refugees, hospitality, honor, death. Nevertheless, there are minor differences that add to the richness of the culture.
                            <ul>
                                <li>I love how the planet is not a homogeneous monolith. The climate and geography vary throughout: volcanoes, islands, different kinds of winter from the thore forests to the gobrin sheet. It is also politically varied: two main nationstates with contrasting cultures.</li>
                                <li>Le Guin subverts our own world's history/culture
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>e.g She put the Taoist religion in the feudalistic medieval nation, while the monotheistic religion in the soviet-like state</li>
                                        <li>e.g. lack of war, only small-scale raids</li>
                                        <li>e.g. Technology is electric and slow-paced, communication centered on radio due to cultural preference (from oral storytelling) for audio rather than writing</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Gender ‚Äî One of the central questions Le Guin wanted to explore was essentially ‚Äúwhen you strip away gender from identity, at its core is there something fundamentally human that we all share?‚Äù And the beauty of this story is that she does not answer this definitively. There are times when she seems to say yes (the culture being similar to ours). There are times when she says no (lack of war, hospitality, leniency of guards at Pulefen, Estraven's capacity for sacrifice, etc.)</li>
                        <li>This was a keystone work in both the feminist and gay rights movements. However:
                            <ul>
                                <li><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness#Reception">Some</a> people did not like the book because it uses he/him pronouns. Ok but consider the following reasons/alternatives:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Neopronouns were not popular during the 60s</li>
                                        <li>Le Guin could've used they/them but this was also not popular in the 60s. Also, in a story where one of the central conflicts is the individual vs society, distinguishing between single people and groups seems important.</li>
                                        <li>For Ai's accounts, perhaps this is could be interpreted a in-universe reflection of his misogyny manifesting in his writing.</li>
                                        <li>For Estraven's accounts and the myths, this could also be interpreted as misogyny from the translators manifesting in the translation.</li>
                                        <li>Like this is a valid criticism, I too have some improvement suggestions for the English pronoun system, but it is really frustrating to see people not liking this book as a whole just for a pronoun, which is such a minor detail in comparison to the overlooked leaps this work has made in their favour.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness#Sex_and_gender">Some</a> people saw (spoiler, highlight to reveal) <span style="background-color: var(--dark)">Estraven's death</span> as homophobic. Gay people are human too. All humans die. If Le Guin truly was homophobic, she couldn't have even approached anything like this story. She simply didn't feel like this story needed a "they lived happily ever after."
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Constructed Language ‚Äî the names of people, places and other things
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conlang feels realistic. No stereotypical alien x's and apostrophes.</li>
                        <li>Unique phonotactics ‚Äî Mix of German, Arabic, English. There are even differences between Orgota and Karhidish ‚Äî another point for the non-monolithic culture mentioned above.</li>
                        <li>Linguistic relativity ‚Äî Descriptive words for snow/cold, immersive cultural expressions like <i>nusuth</i> and <i>gichy-michy</i></li>
                        <li>If this gets a movie adaptation (the dream, and I hope Villeneuve directs it like he did with <i>Dune</i>), I would love David J. Peterson to expand the conlang like he did for GoT and the Dune movie's Chakobsa.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3><i>Roadside Picnic</i> <small>by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</small></h3>
            <small>September - October 15, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Plot ‚Äî The main thing I understood was that it was meant to capture the slow descent into madness of the main character, but because the chapters were so long, it was hard to identify key plot points
                    <ul>
                        <li>The long chapters also made it hard to start and stop reading. There were no clear breakpoints, so often I had to break it at a point that I didn't realize was important, and it would be hard to get back into the flow later.</li>
                        <li>Another thing that was confusing was the shifts in perspective and time between chapters. The only hint that I got of these changes were the titles of the chapters, which did not really stand out. Noonan's chapter did at least provide an interesting outsider perspective of Red and his enemies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The imagery, the descriptions of the things from the Zone were great. Surreal yet rugged.</li>
                <li>Language ‚Äî Honestly the fact that there was so much vernacular is impressive. If this from the original Russian, the Strugatskys did a great job capturing this feel in a language that, according to the afterword, did not really have this kind of language before this book. If this was after the translation, the translator did a great job interpreting the feel that the authors were going for and implanting it into English; it really fits in well.</li>
                <li>The bleak depressing vibe was visceral, well done. It reminds me of <i>I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream</i>, but whereas that was more physical pain, this was more psychological pain.</li>
                <li>Characters
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sometimes it's hard to argue with Red's worldview when you consider the horrible environment around him. Superficially he has a disagreeable character, but because we can hear his thoughts he is easier to sympathize and pity.</li>
                        <li>What made Red's speech near the end so realistic and powerful was that he actually partly made sense; he was not rambling nonsense. Well, perhaps as a standalone speech it would be nonsense, but because we have prior context from the rest of the book, because the Zone is already so irrational, the reader can sympathize with his chaotic and broken emotional state at this point. Additionally, he was discussing some aspect about his character: his principles and his independence. This is subjective and indisputable, as opposed to some revelation or profound universal truth which another author would likely place here, during an ending climactic emotional scene, and this would end up sounding fake or melodramatic.</li>
                        <li>Aside from the length of chapters, the other thing I would change is the treatment of women. The Vulture was gross, Noonan was gross in those two moments with the Madam and the Monkey. Redrick seemed ok at first bc he actually cared about Guta, but when he was with Noonan he really treated Guta like a servant. This is the one thing about his character that I do not agree with; you can be depressed and still treat women better than that; the Zone gives you no excuse to act this way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Overall, understandably a classic; I can see its influence and resemblance in a lot of other artworks and popular culture.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3><i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> <small>by Margaret Atwood</small></h3>
            <small>September - October 15, 2022</small> | ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ
            <ul>
                <li>Plot ‚Äî Atwood manages to make a humdrum life interesting, partly thanks to the rich worldbuilding</li>
                <li>Worldbuilding ‚Äî The fact that she based a lot of this on real-world historical precedents is what makes the worldbuilding feel realisting and rich, just like Le Guin in LHOD</li>
                <li>Characters ‚Äî The fact that Offred was caught in a multi-podal sociopolitical structure (unstable, as the Reverend Mother would say) demonstrates nuances in each character: the Commander at Jezebels, Serena Joy's desire for a baby, Ofglen and Mayday, and Offred's personal desire for Nick. As unlikeable some of them may be, each of their motives are realistic. Often the issue lies in their means not necessarily their ends.</li>
                <li>A 1986 <a class="link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/26/specials/mccarthy-atwood.html">review</a> by Mary McCarthy of the NYT criticized Atwood's dystopia by its lack of any form of Newspeak. As a worldbuilder, I can sympathize with the desire for further immersion, richer culture. Yet I can speak for the other side as well.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, much of the story lies within Offred's thoughts, where she is not obliged to use the filtered language imposed on her. And on the rare chance outside that women may speak, she indeed takes care; ‚ÄúPraise be,‚Äù she recites repeatedly and automatically, like a prayer machine.</li>
                        <li>Secondly, the revolution only happened a few years ago; such a culture would take time to develop, or at least get used to even if it were imposed. People are still not believers, but fearful. And their fear of the Eyes does not apply in the private situations of Offred's relationships.</li>
                    </ul>
                Nevertheless, as I have read Atwood's other works, and I do agree with the review in that it seems like Offred is speaking with Atwood's voice; contrast this with Walter Dean Myers' colloquial and poetic dexterity in <i>Fallen Angels</i> above.
                </li>
                <li>Themes & Motifs
                    <ul>
                        <li>Atwood touches upon a variety of social issues related to religion, gender, and the way she presents balanced perspectives using the voices of various characters around Offred is very convincing.</li>
                        <li>I do agree with other people mentioning how she does not discuss race ‚Äì a society like this is bound to have something to say about this issue, and the lack of their perspective is unusual, slightly immersion-breaking but not fundamentally story-breaking.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h1>generAl preferences</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not take these too rigidly. These are merely trends I have noticed among the books I like vs the ones I don't like.</li>
                <li>Science fiction, particularly New Wave, but really I can read any genre if it is written well. I know how to appreciate any work even if it doesn't match my tastes.</li>
                <li>Detailed worldbuilding, with attention to scientific accuracy, historical precedent, and human behaviour</li>
                <li>Pushes the boundaries of the human experience -- fiction allows the reader to experience a greater extent of pain and joy than in their own lives.</li>
                <li>Slice of life, <i><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware">mono no aware</a></i></li>
                <li>Complex characters ‚Äî deep thinkers, diverse perspectives, morally ambiguous characters, characters that span or break free from archetypes, etc.</li>
                <li>Complex plots ‚Äî Plots that make the brain do work</li>
                <li>Indescribable or ambivalent emotions e.g. nostalgia</li>
                <li>Explores an array of independent philosophical themes which challenge my own philosophy or become something I can assimilate. When I read, aside from entertainment I aim to grow as a person.</li>
                <li>Beautiful, quotable, poetic, "Borgesian" phrases, though I like vernacular language too if it increases immersion</li>
                <li>I don't mind spoilers since it is the qualia, the journey of reading, that I value, not so much the ending.</li>
