            <div id="title">MAking sense of three.js shAders</div>
            <div id="subtitle">By Luke Arcamo â€” July 8, 2021</div>
            Three.js comes with several materials built-in, but customizing these materials can be difficult because there isn't really a "clean" way to do it.
            There is the option of writing a custom shader, but then you don't have access to all of the lighting, fog, skinning, etc. that the default shaders come with (unless you write them in yourself).
            The more hacky method is to use the default materials' <code>onBeforeCompile</code> callback to inject your own code into the shader source.
            For both of these methods, it is important to understand Three.js shaders in order to be able to modify them. Unfortunately, shaders lack sufficient information on the Three.js website
            so after exploring the Three.js code, here is a guide to the shaders. Note that this is not a full detailed documentation, only a guide. Also note that this article assumes that you have
            foundational knowledge on shaders. If not, then check out the <a class="link" href="resources.html">resources</a> page to learn more about shaders.
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: var(--white); padding-top: 10vh;">
            <h1>code structure</h1>
            <p>
                In Three.js repo, material shaders are located under <code>src/renderers/shaders</code>. Since materials may share different parts of a shader, Three.js divides the shaders into shader chunks.
                These shaders consist of several <code>#include</code> directives, which are eventually replaced by the actual shader chunk code before they are compiled.
            </p>
            <p>
                These chunks are entirely or parially enabled/disabled using preprocessor directives, which depend on various settings in the form of defines.
                <!-- https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/renderers/webgl/WebGLProgram -->
                This long list of defines are prepended to the shaders in <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/webgl/WebGLProgram.js#L431">WebGLProgram.js</a>,
                which are in turn based on the long list of material parameters in the confusingly named <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/webgl/WebGLPrograms.js#L154">WebGLPrograms.js</a>.
                Note that these functions/objects are in the back-end, so they are not exported and are only accessible if you delve into the code. 
                The most documentation that I've found on the Three.js website about Three.js shaders is the one for <a class="link" href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/renderers/webgl/WebGLProgram">WebGLProgram</a>.
            <p>
            </p>
                Additionally, some shader functions are defined only in these obscure locations as well.
                For example, the <code>encodings_pars_fragment</code> is imported into every fragment shader but it is not found in the fragment shader code. It is prepended by <code>WebGLProgram</code>.
                The only way to see this chunk is to either delve into the GitHub code or manually create errors using the material's <code>onBeforeCompile</code> callback.
                Another example is the function <code>mapTexelToLinear</code>, which is an alias for one of the several encoding functions. Which one it corresponds to
                is determined in WebGLProgram as well, hardcoded as a GLSL define via JS.
            </p>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderChunk">shaders/ShaderChunk/</a><br>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderChunk.js">shaders/ShaderChunk.js</a>
            <p>
                <code>shaders/ShaderChunk/</code> contains individual JS files which export GLSL code wrapped in a JS string variable.
                This makes it easy for <code>shaders/ShaderChunk.js</code> to simply import these GLSL code strings and map them to a corresponding name in the <code>THREE.ShaderChunk</code> object.
                Additionally, <code>THREE.ShaderChunk</code> also contains the complete shader code strings from <code>shaders/ShaderLib/</code>.
            </p>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib">shaders/ShaderLib/</a>
            <p>
                <code>shaders/ShaderLib/</code> contains the vertex and fragment shader GLSL code for each material, which are also stored in JS strings.
            </p>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib.js">shaders/ShaderLib.js</a>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/UniformsLib.js">shaders/UniformsLib.js</a>
            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/src/renderers/shaders/Uniformsutils.js">shaders/UniformsUtils.js</a>
            <p>
                Since not all shader chunks use all uniforms, uniforms are also broken into chunks, found in the the <code>THREE.UniformsLib</code> object.
                <code>THREE.Shaderlib</code> uses <code>THREE.UniformsUtils</code> for deep copying objects in order to combine the shader code into one object, along with only the necessary uniforms for each material.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: var(--white);">
            <h1>chunks</h1>
            <h2>coMMon & pAcking</h2>
            <p>
                Common and packing are two shader chunks found near the top of most shaders, after the material-specific uniforms and varyings. Packing is only found in fragment shaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common contains mathematical constants, like pi and epsilon. It also contains arithmetic, geometric, and matrix functions which are not built into GLSL,
                as well as three structs: IncidentLight, ReflectedLight, and GeometricContext.
                Packing contains functions and constants for encoding and decoding values to fit into other compact formats.
                Packing also contains functions for converting between z coordinates, orthographic depth, and perspective depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three structs from common are quite significant.
            </p>
            <h2>pArs</h2>
            <p>
                After common and packing, there are several more chunks located before the <code>main()</code> function, with the majority of them containing the word "pars".
                "pars" is short for "parameters". These chunks contain uniform declarations, varying declarations, and functions.
            </p>
            For vertex shaders, this section can be roughly divided into these main categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Varyings (color [vertex colors], uv, and uv2 [the second UV channel is only used for lightmaps and aomaps])</li>
                <li>Maps (displacementmap, envmapmap, etc.)</li>
                <li>Deformation (morphtarget, skinning)</li>
                <li>Other (shadowmap, fog, logdepthbuf, clipping_planes, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            And for fragment shaders, this section is roughly structured like so:
            <ul>
                <li>Varyings (color [vertex colors], uv, and uv2 [the second UV channel is only used for lightmaps and aomaps])</li>
                <li>Maps (map, lightmap, normalmap, metalnessmap, etc.)</li>
                <li>Lighting (brdf & shadow functions and structs, etc.)</li>
                <li>Other (dithering, fog, logdepthbuf, clipping_planes, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>MAin</h2>
            <p>
                As with all shaders, the <code>void main()</code> function is where the real bulk of the calculations happen. After getting to know the uniforms, varyings, and functions, it is important
                to understand the main function in order to figure out where you should insert your code.
            </p>
            <p>
                In vertex shaders, the chunks take all of the attributes and calculate the varyings. The main function begins with simple uv calculations, followed by vertex colors.
                They are followed by the normals and tangents which are then altered by morphing and skinning-related chunks, and then their appropriate transformation matrices.
                However, if flat shading is enabled, the real normal is actually calculated within the fragment shader using the <code>OES_standard_derivatives</code> functions.
                Afterwards, the vertices are modified like the normals, and are followed by some other calculations for varyings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fragment shaders, the beginning of the main function usually contains a <code>vec4 diffuseColor</code>, a <code>ReflectedLight reflectedLight</code>,
                and the chunks related to discarding fragments (clipping planes, alphatest).
                Later on, an <code>IncidentLight directLight</code> is created and is shared between all light sources, with only its data being modified for each iteration through the light sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the chunks in <code>main()</code> use <code>diffuseColor</code>, <code>reflectedLight</code>, and <code>directLight</code>, to either modify them
                or use them to calculate the final color used for gl_FragColor, <code>outgoingLight</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last chunks are the final modifications of the output color; they are meant to go after all of the color, lighting, and shadow calculations.
                This section includes tonemapping, encoding the output, applying fog color, premultiplying alpha, and dithering.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" style="background-color: var(--white);">
            <h1>exAMples & deMos</h1>
            <p>
                I believe that examples are an excellent way to learn new things. Here are some simple common situations in which you may want to edit Three.js shaders, along with a
                more complex and specific example at the end of this section.
            </p>
            <h2>Vertex deforMAtion</h2>
            <p>
                This is very similar to the example for modified materials already on the <a class="link" href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_modified">Three.js website</a>.
                Hopefully, with newfound insight, you may understand it better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flat shading is enabled so that normals are calculated per fragment rather than using the normal attribute.
                This does not work for lambert materials since it calculates lighting in the vertex shader.
                Technically, you could manually recalculate normals if you had tangents and bitangents.
                See <a class="link" href="https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/post/015-wobble-displacement/">this article</a> for how to do this.

                This demo shows how near the very end of a shader, you can apply your own postprocessing to the outputted color.
                In this case, the color components are swizzled from rgb to brg, and then the contrast is increased.
                I placed my code before the tonemapping and encoding fragments, so that they would still apply after my changes.
                But the beauty of this system is you can include them before or after your changes, or you can even or override them if you wanted to.

            <h1>tool</h1>
            While exploring Three.js shaders, I got tired of going on GitHub and opening the numerous tiny ShaderChunk files. I also got tired of using <code>console.log</code> to messily print out shaders.
            I also wanted to see the shaders in their complete form. So, I created a tool to help explore Three.js shaders more easily. It features:
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax highlighting via highlight.js</li>
                <li>Individually expandable shader chunks, with buttons to expand/contract all</li>
                <li>You can also use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd></li>
                <li>To view different shaders from <code>THREE.ShaderLib</code>, replace the URL query string with the format <code>&lt;name&gt;_&lt;vs|fs&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>phong_fs</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            However, I still highly suggest going into the GitHub code if you don't understand a certain bit since, as I've mentioned before, there are many obscure back-end defines, and comments that aren't present in the final Three.js builds.
            Anyways, <a class="link" href="schunks_explorer.html?lambert_vs">here is the tool.</a>
